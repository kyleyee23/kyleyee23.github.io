Hi! I'm a Junior at Swarthmore College, a small school outside of Philadelphia, where I'm working towards a double major in Physics and Computer Science and take some extra courses in Math. I also play cello at Swarthmore, where I am first desk in the college orchestra, perform in a piano trio, and study privately. 

Outside of classes, I like to collect mechanical keyboards, road bike, and tinker with electronics.
