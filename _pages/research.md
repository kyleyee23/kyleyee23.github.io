## 2018
I was an REU participant at the Big Data Analytics site at Washington University in Saint Louis. With Dr. Ayan Chakrabarti, I designed an efficient deep-learning model for stereo depth estimation in autonomous vehicles. We worked in low-level TensorFLow, and created a model which performs depth estimation on high-resolution images 1.5x faster than state-of-the-art methods. We are continuing our work throughout the next several months, and will be submitting our results for publishing in early 2019. 

## 2017

I took part in an REU at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, where I completed independent computer vision research under the guidance of Dr. Jonathan Ventura. The goal of this project was to use convolutional neural networks along with recent super-resolution architecture to localize fluorescent proteins. You can find the final paper from the Summer [here](/assets/pdfs/reu_final.pdf).
