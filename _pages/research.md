## 2017

This Summer, I took part in an REU at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, where I completed independent computer vision research under the guidance of Dr. Jonathan Ventura. The goal of this project was to use convolutional neural networks along with recent super-resolution architecture to localize fluorescent proteins. You can find the final paper from the Summer [here](/assets/pdfs/reu_final.pdf); we intend on submitting for publishing in Spring 2018!
