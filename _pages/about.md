Hi! I'm a Senior at Swarthmore College, where I study Math and Computer Science. I also play cello, where I am the first desk in the college orchestra, perform in a piano trio, and study privately with a cellist in the Philadelphia Orchestra.  

After Swarthmore, I hope to pursue a graduate degree in machine learning. In the meantime, I've taken courses in machine learning and AI and independently organized directed readings in deep learning and bioinformatics. I've also done some research in computer vision, which you can read about in the Research section above!

Outside of classes, I like to cycle, collect mechanical keyboards, and bowl.
