Hi! I'm a Junior at Swarthmore College, a small liberal arts college outside of Philadelphia. At Swarthmore, I'm working towards a double major in Physics and Computer Science. I also play cello at Swarthmore, where I am the first desk in the college orchestra, perform in a piano trio, and study privately.  

After Swarthmore, I'm aiming to get a graduate degree in machine learning. In the meantime, I've taken courses in machine learning and AI. I've also done some research in computer vision this past summer, which you can read about in the Research section above!

Outside of classes, I like to collect mechanical keyboards, road bike, and tinker with electronics.
